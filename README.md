# Vineyard Cincinnati Church - New Family Check-In Labeler

New Family Check-In Labeler (NFCIL) is a web-app that can be used to create child ID labels quickly and easily.  The NFCIL will ask for just 3 pieces of information:
  - Each Child's First & Last name
  - Each Child's Grade
  - Current Service Time

# Get Started
In order for NFCIL to work properly, you must have the following system components:
 - A webserver running PHP
 - A computer or tablet with a network connection
 - Paper labels, 4" x 3"
 - An individual label printer capable of printing 4" x 3" labels
   - Example: Zebra GC420d/T
